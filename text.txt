## First-Time Buyers
A relief for first-time buyers is available, which increases the residential nil rate band of LBTT to £175,000.

From 1 April 2021, the availability of the relief will result in a reduction in tax of up to £600 for qualifying first-time buyers, relative to the rates which would have otherwise applied.




## Additional Dwelling Supplement
On 1 April 2016 the LBTT Additional Dwelling Supplement (ADS) came into force, payable on the total purchase price of an additional dwelling of £40,000 or more.

The ADS is charged at 4% of the total purchase price of the dwelling.

The supplement forms an important element of the Scottish Government’s drive to protect opportunities for first-time buyers in Scotland, reinforcing the progressive approach in place for LBTT rates and bands.
